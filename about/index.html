  <p>
  I'm passionate about lots of things software & tech. I'm also a hobbyist bassist and appriciative of the outdoors.
  Since this site is mainly focused on my endevours in tech, I'll keep this section geeky.
  </p>
  <p>
  I have Computer Engineering background focused on Software Engineering. The below are my current areas of interest:
  <ul>
    <li>Machine Learning + Recommender Systems</li>
    <li>Progressive Web Apps + EcmaScript + Web Assembly</li>
    <li>Algorithms</li>
    <li>Tech education</li>
    <li>Distributed Systems (Paxos, Rift etc.)</li>
  </ul>
 </p>

  I favor statically typed programming languages for working in large teams. However, I do enjoy type inference, specially in declaring local variabels.
  Generics, are great. No, Functional Progamming (FP) is not just for academics. Careful, though, this doesn't mean Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is bad and we
  should do away with it. OOP is great for systems that actually interact with the world, FP is more suited for data manipulations, pipelining etc.
  That's my take on the debate xD.

  Currently, I mainly work using ReactJS + the Hack progamming language. No tribalism here, I can switch / learn
  any programming language needed for the job.
