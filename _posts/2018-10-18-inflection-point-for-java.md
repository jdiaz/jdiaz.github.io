If you were eager to try Java SE 11 and went to download the [official JDK](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk11-downloads-5066655.html), then you were greeted with a curve ball message.

The message reads something along the lines of: 'Heads up we changed our license, read it'. Upon reading you'll notice several changes, but the most outstanding one is:

Exerpt:

> Further, You may not:
  use the Programs for any data processing or any commercial, production, or internal business purposes other than developing, testing, prototyping, and demonstrating your Application;

There it is, pay up if you want to use JDK 11 or greater on for your commercial systems. Thats right, the official JDK implementation by Oracle is now pay to use (commercially). If you don't want to participate in the endless commercial subscription model to run your system you must embrace the sometimes has been referred to as [not-production-ready in the past](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9344243/openjdk-ready-for-production), the [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/).

Granted, its possible to run your system on the OpenJDK, but it could require some carefuly testing and porting over any dependencies.

This is a bold move from Oracle, one that in my opinion could lead to a loss in market share for the Java programming language. At first glance the market share for Java seems [pretty strong](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) on the Tobie index. Redmonk ranks it [second next to JS](http://sogrady-media.redmonk.com/sogrady/files/2018/08/lang.rank_.618-1.png). These indexes track things like [Google searches, Github projects and Youtube videos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIOBE_index). The signs all point to Java remaning strong. However, I argue we are at a turning point in that dominance. Why? Let's look at developer happyness. How happy are developers using programming languages. Stack overflow annually polls developers actually using progamming languges and publishes the results. Python tops the most [loved of them all](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/#most-popular-technologies) and Java polls at a 45%. Now lets look at the [most dreaded](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/#most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted) languages, Java polls at 49%. Programmers seem to dread Java more than they love it. There could be [many reasons for those results](). I would argue that the combination of Java being dreaded by 50% of devs and businesses having to pay for commercial use will kickoff the exodous from the JVM for newly written systems. If you've ever tried to get your boss to let you use that shinny open source technology you wanted, now is the time, you will probably be heard.

On the other hand, It is my belief that programming language trends are purely driven by business interests. You see software engineers, developers, programmers, or however you'd like to call us, at the end of the day are still employees of business (if not entreprenours). This means our actions we take each day are done increase the bottom line, shareholder value, or gain a competetive advantage. Thus, the business will always want to reduce cost and increase profit. Re-writting a system written in Java into a new language is an expensive undertaking both in terms of payroll and business risk. This is why Banks rather [keep retired Cobol programmers out of retirement](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-banks-cobol/banks-scramble-to-fix-old-systems-as-it-cowboys-ride-into-sunset-idUSKBN17C0D8)than to invest into re-writting massive legacy systems. There is a whole industry around keeping it running i.e. [cobolcowboys](http://cobolcowboys.com/). This is probably the sole reasing why, following the news from Oracle about them charging for the JDK distribution, Amazon announced their no-cost distribution based on the OpenJDK, [Corretto](https://aws.amazon.com/corretto/). Why would any business do this? Well, for one [Amazon is built on Java](https://www.quora.com/Why-does-Amazon-mostly-use-Java). Another reason why Amazon would be so bullish on Java is the fact that they have the [father of Java himself](https://twitter.com/errcraft), James Gosling, on their payroll. The same can be true for many corporations in America and they will not incur in the cost of re-writting all of those systems. 

Alright, the cost and risk involved in migrating / re-writting systems is high. But why new businesses choose Java to write their systems? Surely, this is were Java will start to loose market share, Right? Not entirely, while its certainly true that most startups don't choose Java for their initial system implementations [], successfull one's end up re-writting them in Java. Most notoriously, Twitter [migrated](https://readwrite.com/2011/07/06/twitter-java-scala/) from Ruby to Scala (a JVM language). They do so for performace reasons and achieving scalability. However. the real reason in my view that businesses stay with Java is the talent pool. Java has a huge audience, as one of my ex-coworkers used to say: "Throw a penny in any direction, you'll hit a Java programmer". Businesses need to hire fast, and have engineers be productive on day one. Thus, it makes sense they use the [most popular language](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) out there. This makes sense since its been around for two decades, its taught in school, and by now virtually every developer knows it or has had some expore to it. This makes "ramp up" time period for new hires short leading to businessess seeing a return on their money faster. If any employee should quit, then not a big problem, they can easily be replaced with any one of the [thousands of Java programmers out there](http://infomory.com/numbers/number-of-java-developers/). Imagine investing lots of time in teaching a new hire Haskell, only to then have this person leave shortly after. How much money has been spent teaching this person from one or more teammates? I argue that this inhertia alone will keep Java around for another decade or so.

Only time will tell what will happen. One thing is certain, JVM based systems will be around still a decade from now.
