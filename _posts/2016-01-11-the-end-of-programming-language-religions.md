title: "The end of programming language religions"

Human beings have and always will be emotional creatures. We create attachments to the up most mundane things. Anything from coffee mugs, key chains, t-shirts and even underwear gets targeted by our irrational thoughts. Needless to say, this very same behavior extends over to the computer science world.  

Many modern day programmers are obsessed over the language they programming in. They will subscribe to a programming language camp like religion and formulate strong and passionate opinions. Later, they will proceed to swear by it, passive-aggressively tweet about it, blog about it, and scold anyone who disagrees. Of course, this behavior stems from my previous comments. Now, people can act as they want. However, scolding is the kind of behavior can become a problem, especially to new people in the community. New comers often suffer the most from these individuals because they either get discouraged from programming or worse become biased and perpetuate the cycle themselves.  

In spite of the previous, this article is not about how terrible the programming world is. No. This article is really about a simple truth. The question of which is 'best' programming language can finally be put to rest. Programmers everywhere can unsubscribe to their favorite camp and realize the simple fact: It does not matter what is your favorite programming language because '[the cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing)' has liberated you from your own biase.

Modern application architectures often involve the use of [microservices](http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html). This approach fosters polyglot systems and with it the end of 'my language is better than yours' fad. Instead we can put aside our opinions and focus on using the right tool for the job. Further, [PaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service) like [Cloud Foundry](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/),  [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/), etc.,  or [IaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing#Infrastructure_as_a_service_.28IaaS.29) like [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) provide support for running practically any application written in any of the top popular languages as stated by the [TIOBE](http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html) index.  These tools have not only enabled scaling our applications, but also contributed to eliminating our programming language biases by promoting an open mind when it comes to choosing the language in which we write our applications.  

Evidence of polyglot systems can be found by looking of [server side languages used in successful mainstream companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_languages_used_in_most_popular_websites). Google alone uses [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language), [C++](http://www.cplusplus.com/), [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/index.html), [Python](https://www.python.org/) and now its incorporating [Go](https://golang.org/) to its infrastructure. Facebook runs largely on [PHP](http://php.net/manual/en/index.php), but with its recent acquisition of What'sApp now forced its hand to use [Erlang](http://www.erlang.org/) and others. Twitter started out as a [Ruby on rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) shop and shifted to the [JVM](http://openjdk.java.net/) and [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/).  Python powers Pinterest and the story goes on.  The end of chatroom rants and passionate arguing over programming languages is done. Polyglot systems may be the solution to our irrational thoughts. Of course, it does create another problem, project management.  Software projects have always been proven to be hard to manage, now throw in the mix a 3 to 4 programming languages and a whole thing can go up in smoke. However, this is a separate topic all on its own and deserves its own article.

Another disadvantage I see with this emerging trend is an increase of reading/learning material for us the developers and engineers who have to implement these systems. Now, instead of knowing [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL), [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML), [CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html), [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) and the server side language of your choice to write a basic webapp, you will need to additionally know [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/). That is, without mentioning having to know x client side framework, y server side framework, z [NoSQL](http://nosql-database.org/) databases, and the increase in build tools. This increase in complexity can drive any good dev to insanity.

All in all, these changes and emerging trends will hopefully bring us closer, while steering us away from attacking each other with passive-aggresive tweets.
