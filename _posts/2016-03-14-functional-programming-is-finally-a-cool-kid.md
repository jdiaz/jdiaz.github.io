It may not be *mainstream*, but functional programming seems to be becoming increasingly popular. Of course, as with anything, it could be also a matter of perception... or is it? At least it appears so, considering the updates, languages and features used in some of today's popular software projects.

What follows is a series of ramblings to support such statement.

By mid 2014 Java, the dominant force in enterprise and IT organizations, gets upgraded with lambdas, method references, and streams among other features, in its Java8 release. Of course by this time, cutting edge companies like Twitter and Linked had already adopted Scala as their language of choice for writing their [software infrastructure](https://www.redfin.com/devblog/2010/05/how_and_why_twitter_uses_scala.html) .

The clock ticks and its 2015... IT leaders read their magazines or some blog article and find out that Netflix has enjoyed great success with their current infrastructure. Suddenly, everyone wants microservices for their IT org. When reading about
[how they did it](http://techblog.netflix.com/2013/01/optimizing-netflix-api.htm) they find that a functional reactive platform written in Java is responsible. They scratch their heads and call in the consultants.

Around 2012-2013 Big Data becomes a huge selling point for consulting companies. They milk [Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org) dry. Suddenly, a new player comes waltzing in... they call it Spark. Now, [Spark](https://spark.apache.org) promises on delivering better results than Hadoop. It also brings into the spotlight that language some developers wanted to avoid 10 years back, Scala. Spark, written in Scala, makes heavy use of functional programing benefits of it. As of today, scala gets another important adition to its momentun, the [scala center](https://scala.epfl.ch/). The organization is tasked with managing the scala open source community and providing education to speed up the adoption.

Even in the overly passionate world of JavaScript, immutability has been slowly creeping to the cracks. Authors, bloggers, and self proclaimed gurus have also gotten on-board this [emerging trend](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/the-dao-of-immutability-9f91a70c88cd) .

It would seem that success follows Functional Programming and Immutability. Hopefully, it becomes a bigger emphasis on college curriculum. Further, if you plan to stay relevant in the era of multi-cored concurrent & parallel progamming, keep an eye out for [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/) which looks very promising. Who knows maybe I will write about it someday.
